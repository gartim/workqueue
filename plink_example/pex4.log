Writing this text to log file [ pex4.log ]
Analysis started: Wed Oct 14 16:36:09 2015

Options in effect:
	--file pex4
	--out pex4
	--hardy

30 (of 30) markers to be included from [ pex4.map ]
5 individuals read from [ pex4.ped ] 
5 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
2 cases, 3 controls and 0 missing
3 males, 2 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 30 SNPs
5 founders and 0 non-founders found
Writing Hardy-Weinberg tests (founders-only) to [ pex4.hwe ] 
0 markers to be excluded based on HWE test ( p <= 0.001 )
	0 markers failed HWE test in cases
	0 markers failed HWE test in controls
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.986667
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 30 SNPs
After filtering, 2 cases, 3 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 3 males, 2 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
