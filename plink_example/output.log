30 (of 30) markers to be included from [ example.map ]
20 individuals read from [ example.ped ] 
20 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
11 cases, 9 controls and 0 missing
12 males, 8 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 30 SNPs
20 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.961667
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 30 SNPs
After filtering, 11 cases, 9 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 12 males, 8 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
